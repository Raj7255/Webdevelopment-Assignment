Q.> Explain the difference between justify-items and justify-self using code examples.
Ans-->
 The justify-items and `justify-self` properties in CSS are used to align items horizontally.

 The main difference between the two is how the alignment is applied.
- justify-items aligns items in the parent container, while justify-self aligns items with respect to their own container .

- The justify-items property is used on a grid container to control how the grid items are aligned along the row (inline) axis by setting the default,
  while justify-self property for all child grid items. It affects the alignment of all grid items collectively within the grid container.

Example of justify-items:-
<div class="grid-container">
  <div class="grid-item">Item 1</div>
  <div class="grid-item">Item 2</div>
  <div class="grid-item">Item 3</div>
</div>

.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 100px);
  justify-items: center;
}

.grid-item {
  background-color: lightblue;
  padding: 10px;
}
