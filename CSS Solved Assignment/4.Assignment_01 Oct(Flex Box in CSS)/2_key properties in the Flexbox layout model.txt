Q2. Explain the role of the following key properties in the Flexbox layout model
   
       1. Justify-content:-
Ans--> Justify-content is a key property in the Flexbox layout model that determines the alignment of flex items along the cross axis.
     It takes values of `flex-start`, `flex-end`, `center`, `space-between`, and `space-around`. Setting `justify-content` to `flex-start` or `flex-end` aligns the flex items to the beginning or end of the container, respectively. `Center` aligns the items in the middle. `Space-between` and `space-around` distribute the space between or around the flex items, respectively.
     These properties help in organizing and aligning flex items in a containers with a flexible layout.  

     2. Align-items:-
        The `align-items` property in the Flexbox layout model is used to align the flex items (child elements) within a flex container. 
        The available alignment methods are `flex-start`, `flex-end`, `center`, `space-between`, and `space-around`. 
        These values determine how the flex items are arranged and distributed within the container. 
        For example, `align-items: flex-start` will align the items at the beginning of the container, while `align-items: center` will center them vertically within the container.

      3.Gap:-
        creating space between lines of text, and defining the default margin and padding for elements. The gap property specifies the default gap between flex items.
        It can be used to set the default gap between elements, or to adjust the gap on a per-element basis.
        The gap property can also be used to create more complex layouts, such as exponential or linear spacings.

      4.Flex-direction:-
        The flex-direction property in the Flexbox layout model determines the main direction of flexbox items. 
        It can be set to one of the following values: row, row-reverse, column, or column-reverse.
        This property helps define the layout of the flexbox and its flex items.  

      5.Flex-wrap:-
        In the Flexbox layout model, the key properties of `flex-wrap` play a crucial role in controlling how flex items are laid out and wrapped to new lines 
        when the available space is insufficient. The `flex-wrap` property can be set to `wrap`, `nowrap`, or `initial`. When set to `wrap`,
        flex items will wrap to the next line when the current line reaches its maximum capacity.
        When set to `nowrap`, flex items will not wrap to new lines under any circumstances. Finally, 
       `initial` sets the property to its default state, which is to wrap flex items to new lines when the available space is insufficient.
