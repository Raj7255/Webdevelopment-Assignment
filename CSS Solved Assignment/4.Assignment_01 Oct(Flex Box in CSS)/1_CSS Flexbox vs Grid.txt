01. Describe the main differeces between the CSS Flexbox layout model and the CSS Grid layout model. When
would you choose to use one over the other?

Ans-->CSS Flexbox and CSS Grid are two popular layout models in CSS. The main differences are:

(i) Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout model that aligns elements horizontally or vertically, while Grid is a two-dimensional model that creates a grid of rows and columns.

(ii) Flexbox is simpler and easier to use for simple layouts, while Grid offers more advanced layout possibilities and is better suited for complex layouts with multiple columns and rows.

(iii) Flexbox is great for creating simple and clean layouts with a small number of elements, while Grid is ideal for large and complex layouts with many elements.

(iv) Use Flexbox for simple, one-dimensional layouts with a small number of elements, like a navigation bar or a list of items, while Use Grid for more complex layouts with multiple dimension.
