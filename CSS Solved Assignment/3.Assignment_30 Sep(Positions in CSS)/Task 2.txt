Q.> Explain the difference between Absolute and Relative positioning.

Ans-->the difference between Absolute and Relative positioning are:-

(i) Absolute positioning refers to the process of defining a website's position in terms of pixels relative to the browser window. This means that the website will remain in the same 
position regardless of the screen size or device used to view it.On the other hand, relative positioning involves defining the position of an element in relation to its parent element,
using percentages or em units. This means that the element will move along with the parent element as the browser window is resized. 

(ii) Absolute positioning is based on the immediate parent element, while relative positioning is based on the normal flow of content.

(iii)  Absolute positioning is more rigid, while relative positioning is more flexible.

(iv) Syntax of Absolute position:- 
       position: absolute;   while,

     Syntax of Relative position:- 
      position: relative;
