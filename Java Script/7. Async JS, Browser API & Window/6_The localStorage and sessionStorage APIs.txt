Q6.Describe the purpose and usage of the localStorage and sessionStorage APIs in web development. Give
suitable examples for each.

ANS=>The localStorage and sessionStorage APIs are mechanisms provided by modern web browsers to store key-value pairs locally within the user's browser. They are part of the Web Storage
 API and serve different purposes based on the lifespan of the stored data.

localStorage:

Purpose: localStorage is designed to persistently store data with no expiration time. This means the data stored in localStorage will remain even after the browser window is closed and reopened.

Usage:
Storing Data: You can store data using localStorage.setItem(key, value) and retrieve it using localStorage.getItem(key).

Example:

// Storing data in localStorage
localStorage.setItem('username', 'John');

// Retrieving data from localStorage
const username = localStorage.getItem('username');
console.log(username); 
// Output: John

Features:
Data remains stored indefinitely unless explicitly deleted by the user or cleared programmatically.
Shared across all tabs and windows from the same origin (domain).
Storage limit is typically around 5MB per domain.



sessionStorage:

Purpose: sessionStorage is designed for temporary storage that is available only during the current browser session. Once the browser tab is closed, the data is cleared and no longer accessible.

Usage:
Storing Data: You can store data using sessionStorage.setItem(key, value) and retrieve it using sessionStorage.getItem(key).

Example:

// Storing data in sessionStorage
sessionStorage.setItem('token', 'abc123');

// Retrieving data from sessionStorage
const token = sessionStorage.getItem('token');
console.log(token); // Output: abc123

Features:
Data is available only within the same session. If the user closes the tab or browser, the data is lost.
Data is scoped to the current tab. Opening a new tab with the same origin will not share sessionStorage data.
Similar storage limit as localStorage (around 5MB per domain).

Comparison:
Persistence: localStorage persists indefinitely until explicitly deleted or cleared, whereas sessionStorage lasts only for the duration of the page session.
Scope: localStorage data is shared across all tabs and windows of the same origin, while sessionStorage is isolated to the current tab.
