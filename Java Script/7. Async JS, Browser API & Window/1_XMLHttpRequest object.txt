Q1. Define XMLHttpRequest object, and How is it used in AJAX?

Ans=>All modern browsers support the XMLHttpRequest object.
* The XMLHttpRequest object can be used to exchange data with a server behind the scenes. 
* This means that it is possible to update parts of a web page, without reloading the whole page.
* All modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, IE7+, Edge, Safari Opera) have a built-in XMLHttpRequest object.
* XMLHttpRequest Is used by JavaScript for communication with the server- side components .
* Transfers data in the form of plain text, XML, or JSON format.
* Retrieves data from the server asynchronously.
* Allows Web pages to request data from a server using client-side code.
* Provides properties and methods to access the server response.
* AJAX Improves performance of the page by enabling users to carry on with their tasks after sending a request to the server.
