Q3. Differentiate between unary, binary, and ternary operators in JavaScript. Give examples of each.

Ans-> Unary operators in JavaScript are those that operate on a single operand. They are used for performing operations like incrementing or decrementing a number, 
bitwise operators, and function calls. Examples of unary operators in JavaScript include +, -, !, ~, and ++.

Binary operators, on the other hand, are those that operate on two operands. They are used to perform arithmetic and logical operations. Examples of binary operators in JavaScript 
include +, -, \*, \/, %, ==, !=, &&, ||, and &&.

Ternary operators in JavaScript are used for performing conditional operations. They take the form of a question mark followed by a colon, 
An example of a ternary operator is (x > 0) ? x : -x.
