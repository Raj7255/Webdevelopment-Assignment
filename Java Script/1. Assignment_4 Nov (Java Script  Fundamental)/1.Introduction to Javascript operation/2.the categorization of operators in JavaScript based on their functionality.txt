1. Arithmetic operators: These operators are used for performing mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus. Examples include +, -, \*, /, and %.

2. Comparison operators: These operators are used for comparing two values and returning a Boolean result. Examples include ==, ===, !=, and !=.

3. Logical operators: These operators are used for performing logical operations such as AND, OR, and NOT. Examples include &&, ||, and !.

4. Assignment operators: These operators are used for assigning a value to a variable. 

Additionally, there are bitwise operators, which perform operations on the bits of a binary number.
