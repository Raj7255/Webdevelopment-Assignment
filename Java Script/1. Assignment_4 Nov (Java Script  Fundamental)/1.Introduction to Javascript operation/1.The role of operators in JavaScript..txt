Q1. Explain the role of operators in JavaScript. Why are they essential in programming?
Ans--> In JavaScript, operators are symbols that perform specific tasks on values, such as arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /, %, etc.),
 comparison operations (==, !=, <, >, <=, >=, etc.), logical operations (&&, ||, !, etc.), assignment operations (=, +=, -=, *=, /=, %, etc.),
 bitwise operations (&, |, ^, etc.), and ternary operator (? : ). 
Operators are essential in programming because they enable developers to manipulate data, make decisions, and control the flow of execution in a program.
They help make code more concise and expressive, and can also improve code performance by allowing for more efficient computation.
