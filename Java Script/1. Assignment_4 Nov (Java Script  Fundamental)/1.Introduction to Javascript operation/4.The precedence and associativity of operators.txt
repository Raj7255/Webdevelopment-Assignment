Q4. Discuss the precedence and associativity of operators in JavaScript. Why is understanding these concepts
important?

Ans->  Operator precedence and associativity are essential concepts that help us understand how to evaluate expressions containing multiple operations.
In JavaScript, operators can be grouped into higher and lower precedence groups. Higher precedence operators perform their operations before lowerprecedence ones.
Operators of the same precedence are evaluated from left to right. Associativity determines the order in which operators of the same precedence are grouped and evaluated. 

This is important for writing clear and concise code. Misunderstanding operator precedence and associativity can lead to unintended behavior and errors in the code.
