Q.> List and describe the five primitive data types in JavaScript.?

Ans->  JavaScript has six primitive data types, not five. They are: 
1. Number: Represents a numeric value, can be either an integer or a floating-point number. 
2. String: Represents a sequence of characters enclosed in quotation marks. 
3. Boolean: Represents a logical value and can only be one of two values- true or false. 
4. Null: Represents the intentional absence of any object value. 
5. Undefined: Represents a variable that has been declared but has not yet been assigned a value. 
6. Symbol: Represents a unique and immutable primitive value, useful for creating symbolic references.
