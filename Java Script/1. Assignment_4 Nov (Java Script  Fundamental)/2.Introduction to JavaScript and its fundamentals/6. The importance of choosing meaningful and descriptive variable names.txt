Q.> 6: Explain the importance of choosing meaningful and descriptive variable names in JavaScript.Provide an example where using a clear identifier improves code readability.?

Ans->  In JavaScript, choosing variable names is crucial for maintaining code readability and clarity.
It allows developers to quickly understand the purpose of a variable and its relationship to other variables in the code. 
For example, instead of using the variable "a" to represent a user's age, use "userAge" to make the code more clear and easy to understand. 
This not only benefits the developer who initially wrote the code, but also any future developers who may work on the project.
Using descriptive variable names improves the overall quality of the code and makes it easier to navigate and maintain.
